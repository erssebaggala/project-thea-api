# Web Portal

The web portal is used to manage the THEA Server. It shows the list of recruited drivers,
 the tests collected, analysis of movements and tests on a map that shows the identified 
 hotspots and the risk profile of the drivers. It also shows the infection rate the specific
 disease.

On the analysis tab, a map of the driversâ€™ movement is shown for the selected observation 
period.  A list of all drivers on the move in the observation period, is also listed below 
the map. 

For cases where tests are positive, an exposure map is generated showing drivers that were 
in contact with another driver who tested positive recently during the observation period.
