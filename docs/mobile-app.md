# Mobile Application

The mobile application collects timestamp GPS coordinates from the drivers. It shows the current tests status, test history, hotspots, and exposure profile.

During recruitment, the driver will select the project he is participating in, A unique UUID is generated for him/her. This UUID is used to anonymise the driver’s identity.   Once the driver has been enrolled, the mobile application will start collecting GPS coordinates as he/she moves.

The mobile application has screens for showing the tracking status, showing the test history, and displaying hotspots. The tracking status screen shows the tracking activity, the most recent test results and the risk exposure of the driver.  The test results shows all the driver’s previous tests results.
